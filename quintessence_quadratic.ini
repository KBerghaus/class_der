# To fill with scalar field, CLASS requires
#     Omega_fld, Omega_Lambda = 0 and
#     Omega_scf < 0. This is internally understood
#     by CLASS as "fill universe with scf", setting
#     Omega_scf = 1 - everything else.
#
#     In the case of also having dark radiation,
#     there are two paths:
#     - if Omega_dadr is not specified, and scf_Y_da
#       is, then we fill as
#       Omega_scf + Omega_dadr = 1 - everything else
#       which keeps the Universe flat
#     - if Omega_dadr is specified, then we fill as
#       Omega_scf = 1 - everything else
#       where the "everything else" includes dadr
#     In either case, the Universe remains flat

# scf_potential = quadratic / linear / other=CLASS original

#     potential. These are:
#     - quad/phi2 = 1/2 m^2 phi^2
#       when m ~ Hubble the scalar field rolls 
#     - lin/phi1 = C*phi
#       when C > 1e^-9 [Mpl Mpc^-2] the scalar field rolls

#       The upper functioning limit for C is 2.3e-7.
#       Above that, phi rolls to 0 and shooting stops
#       working. This is not a phenomenological
#       interesting region since its ruled out by data.
